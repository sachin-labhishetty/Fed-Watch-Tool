## Description

The tool provides a visual representation of the expected path of policy rate changes. The tool inputs post meeting implied rates (tickerized in bloomberg
eg. USOAFR MMMYYYY) to calculate percent of a single hike (+) or cut (-) at the associated meeting. Subsequently, this percent of a single hike/cut is used to
calculate unconditional probabilities of Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting outcomes to generate a binary probability tree.
